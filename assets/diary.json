This is the number of ways we can pick x objects from n objects. For example, if we are flipping a coin 10 times. 10 choose 3 is the number of ways we could get 3 heads out of that sequence. Great so we have the number of events in the event space that we want to count. Next up, what is the probability of those events? Lets say p is the probability of a success on any given trial. Then if X = 3 and n = 10 we need to have p*p*p or p^3 success and (1-p)^7 failures. The odds of both of those happening (multiply them together) is the odds of one of our events under consideration. So if we multiply that by the number of events we should get the probability of flipping exactly 3 heads over 10 flips. Brilliant. To recap thats (n choose x)*(p^x)*(1-p)^(n-x)."

This is the number of ways we can pick x objects from n objects. For example, if we are flipping a coin 10 times. 10 choose 3 is the number of ways we could get 3 heads out of that sequence. Great so we have the number of events in the event space that we want to count. Next up, what is the probability of those events? Lets say p is the probability of a success on any given trial. Then if X = 3 and n = 10 we need to have p*p*p or p^3 success and (1-p)^7 failures. The odds of both of those happening (multiply them together) is the odds of one of our events under consideration. So if we multiply that by the number of events we should get the probability of flipping exactly 3 heads over 10 flips. Brilliant. To recap thats (n choose x)*(p^x)*(1-p)^(n-x).",

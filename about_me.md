title: About Me
---

Hi, my name is David Folarin but everyone calls me Dave Fol. 
I'm an embedded engineer working at Caterpillar on small track type tractors,
small wheel loaders, telematics, and whatever else they decide to throw at me. 

I graduated from Cornell University with a degree in Psychology. While
at Cornell I had the oppurtunity to be mentored by the brilliant [Shimon Edelman](http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/),
an engineer turned psychologist. Taking classes, doing research under, and having
discussions with Prof. Edelman has dramatically shaped the way I approach the world. 

Originally, I (read: my parents) thought I was going to be a doctor but after
leaving college, and working at a hospital while I did a post-bac in biology, 
I realized that medecine wasn't for me.

Since I was about 10 years old and throughout college, I've been hacking 
on C, C++, OpenGL, Python, Javascript, C#, Rust, R, and a ton of other languages
as well as desigining circuits, CADing parts, 
woodworking, and in general just making cool stuff. 

When I'm not programming, reading about programming, or dreaming about programming, 
I'm usually recording music, doing a sudoku or crossword with my girlfriend, 
or building something with my hands. 

I currently reside in Raleigh, NC with my long-term girlfriend and
my retired racing greyhound.
